✈️ Airline Customer Satisfaction Analysis
📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes airline customer satisfaction using a dataset containing passenger information, travel details, and satisfaction ratings. The goal is to explore the factors that influence customer satisfaction and to build predictive models for classifying whether a customer is satisfied or not.

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)

Scikit-learn (for machine learning)

XGBoost / LightGBM (optional advanced models)

✅ Objectives
Clean and preprocess the airline dataset

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualize trends and patterns in customer satisfaction

Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict satisfaction

Analyze feature importance to understand key drivers of satisfaction

🔍 Key Features
Handling missing values and outliers

Label encoding and one-hot encoding

Data visualization (correlation matrix, histograms, box plots, etc.)

Model comparison: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.

Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC

🧪 Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated based on:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-score

ROC-AUC

Cross-validation

📈 Insights
The analysis reveals important factors that impact customer satisfaction such as:

Flight distance

Inflight service ratings

Class of travel

Delay times
